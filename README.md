# HWR OOP Kingdom (summer term 2025)

This repository contains an example project developed by teachers of the object oriented programming class at HWR Berlin
in summer term 2025.

## Abstract

This project implements a game similar to the popular card game. Similarities are purely random and unintentional.

The following section describes how to add multiple remote repositories to your local repository,
which is cloned from the fork.

### Formatting

The repository contains an IntelliJ IDEA formatter configuration file.
It is located in the `.intellij` folder (not in `.idea`, which is the folder created by IntelliJ IDEA).
To use the formatter, you need to import the configuration into your IntelliJ IDEA settings.

Under **Settings**, go to **Editor**, then **Code Style**, click the **Gear Symbol** next to the Dropdown, click **Import Scheme**, then **IntelliJ IDEA code style XML**. Finally, select the `.intellij/formatter.xml` file.

Make sure to always use the imported `HWR OOP` code style when formatting your code.
Be aware that it might differ from the code style configured in your *Project*, or IntelliJ's *Default* code style.

### Multiple remote repositories

Your local repository should have a reference to both the fork (your own remote repository)
and the original remote repository.
To configure your git remote repositories, use the `git remote` command set.

1. Clone your fork and go enter the repository.

```
git clone <fork-url>
cd <created-folder>
```

2. Now your fork is configured as primary remote repository (origin).
   Next to origin, you should add the original repository as a second remote repository (upstream).

```
git remote add upstream <repository-url>
```

3. Verify that both remotes are configured correctly.
   The following command should list both remotes: origin and upstream.

```
git remote -v
```

4. To fetch changes from all remote repositories, use:

```
git fetch --all
```

5. If there are interesting changes (in e.g. the `main` branch) to merge into your branch, use:

```
git pull upstream main
```
